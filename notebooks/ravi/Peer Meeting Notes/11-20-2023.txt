Objectives: Finalizing python code over fall break


Notes: Met with om in person and guneet virtually over fall break to work on the application, 
flash the firmware code and try to connect to the ESP32 over BLE. Was able to successfully 
send an integer number as a signal from my computer to the ESP32 but not back.
