Team Meeting, 9-21-23

Objectives: Revising Block Diagram with TA


Notes: After incorporating the feedback that we
have recieved recently, we went ahead and revised our 
block diagram and showed our TA. We were told to make some additional
adjustments to our diagram such as labeling voltages and
currents.
