Team Meeting, 8/28/2023

Objectives: Ideating on project ideas

Notes:
-Meeting to figure out which projects to 
move forward with
-I had the idea of a motorized couch which I saw
other people implement online and I thought
it would be a cool idea to implement,
but we wouldn't have a place to store the couch
-Guneet had the idea of a smart home energy monitor
which i immediately liked because of the sustainability
angle and I've also thought of doing something
like that myself
-Om had the idea of an electric longboard
