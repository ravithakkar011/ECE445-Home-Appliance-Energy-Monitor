	-For each component, expand upon them with a few words
	-Subsystem requirements need to have some data
	-Each requirement needs a verification
-Tolerance analysis needs mathematical analysis so there needs to be more detail and more specific numbers
-IEEE code, alter the sentence
-IF you think we're fine with ethical concerns.. we don't have ethical problems or safety problems
	-Mention more about safety with high voltage environment
	-how users will use it safely
