Team Meeting, 9-15-2023

Objectives: Meeting with Machine Shop


Notes: Evaluated potential concerns with the machine shop.

We went to the machine shop to introduce ourselves and explain our project. 
there were potential concerns with having a metal
box because it would potentially block bluetooth
signals which would siginificantly impact our range.
Meeting with Gregg was very helpful because he helped
us inform our physical design of the device.
