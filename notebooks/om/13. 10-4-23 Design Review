Overview: Desgin Review Takeaways

Record: During our design review, the proffessor asked a few questions, some of which are addressed in the guneets 
notebook in "post-ddr) document. Since I am focusing on the PCB and design, some of the design aspect the professor recommended
was:
  Narrow down scope of project to North American Standards: instead of compatibility of 250 V and 20 Amps, focus on 120 V and 20 Amp standard.
  Use 120v to 5v transformer instead of the battery to power low voltage side pcb with one power source.

Also worked on project proposal revision. Revised the block diagram, and some of the subsystem explanations.
