Overview: PCB work and Team Evaluations

Record: Missed the PCB first order from last week, but worked on PCB. Struggled to find some footprints online, but was very helpful using 
the skematic for the ESP32 given online. Went ahead and ordered parts for the PCB with the confirmation of my teammates. Filled out
team evaluations that was due tonight. Slowly chipping away at the PCB. Also completed my high voltage training since our project deals with
up to 120 volts.
