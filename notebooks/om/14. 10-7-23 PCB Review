Overview: PCB design review

Record: Although I had no pcb ready to be reviewed during the PCB review, I creared a sketch out our design to verify if the design would
allow us to power the appliance via the outlet while measuring the voltage and current. I also wanted ot make sure that the power relay
was in the correct spot to turn on and off the appliance while also allowing for correct sensor readings. This sketch is provided in this
notebook under "445_circuit_drawing.pdf". Once we verified the sketch, I also verified if the parts I choose were correct. The TA verified
the parts, sketch, and provided me with the link of the starter schematic for the ESP32 to start designing in kicad.
