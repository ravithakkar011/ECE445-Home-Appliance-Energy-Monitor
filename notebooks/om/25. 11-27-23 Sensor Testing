Overview: Flashing and testing sensors

Record: Fixed flashing issues that we were dealing with over break. Now had to confirm if the firmware worked. We powered on the device and
plugged in a device. Device plugged in would work, but sensor and current readings were kept showing no input. Had to keep checking connections
and test with lab equipment. One test run blew up our current sensor due to voltage arching. Decided to call it quits on the sensor subsystem
and work on the power relay functionality.
