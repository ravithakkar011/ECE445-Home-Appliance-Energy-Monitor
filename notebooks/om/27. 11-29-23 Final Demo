Overview: Final Demo

Record: Performed the final demo and got feedback from the final proffessor to try and get a current sensor module in the design. Then
try to retest to see if we cna produce value for our tests. Power relay worked but would shut off randomly. This was due to a missing 
diode that would have prevented inductive flyback when turning off the relay.Ordered a new current sensor module, and gave enclosure to 
machine shop to create access hole for boot and restart. Also asked to create a spot for current sensor module to sit in.
