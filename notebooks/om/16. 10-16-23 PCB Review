Overview: TA checked PCB

Record: I setup a meeting with Jason, since he know a lot about power electronic. He was able to check over my PCB and provide me with
ways to refine my PCB. The first issue we fixed was the traces for the high current lines. He taught me how to make a plane that would
be wide enough to handle the high voltage. He also provided me with the correct terminals to attach to the PCB for the input and output of
our high voltage lines. We also went over the microcontroller section, that was given by the course, to fully understand what each part does
and how it effects the chips boot mode. With the things he taught me, i went ahead and implemented that and was ready to put in the pcb order
for the second round.
