Overview: Mock Presentation prep

Record: Team meeting to create the presentation for the mock presentation. Created a basic presentation that would relay our messages
of what we will be presenting in the final presentation but was lacking infromation due to time constraint. I filled out the Success and 
Challanges as well as the subsystem overview slides.
