Overview: Began Designing the PCB

Record: I downloaded the necessary software to begin designing the PCB. Although I was able to find many of the parts, I was hesitant 
to truly start designing the board as I wanted to wait till after the design review to confirm our design is valid. Therefore, I played 
around with the kiCad software just to get familiar with it. This was one of my first times using this software besides the CAD 
assignment we had earlier in the semester. I also did some research on how to handle voltage arcing and high current and learned two 
things:
	Give traces room to prevent voltage arcing
	Create thick traces to avoid overheating due to high current
I also needed to confirm what kind of terminals to use for our PCB, if our power relay needs to be single or double pole, and if 
we should have separate PCBâ€™s for low and high voltage sections.
