Overview: Team meeting with machince shop

Record: Met with machine show to discuss ideas of an enclosre. Made sure to let shop know we need something that is insulated, can allow
bluetooth signal to go through, and have an input and output socket. The input would be used to connect a wire from the wall outlet
to our device. The output would be used to connect our device to the home appliance. Machine shop let us know they need us to provide an
extension cord. We need the enclosure to be insulated so the high voltage cannot find a ground through our enclosure. Machine show would 
send us some enclosure options the follwing few weeks.
