Date: Fall Break

Overview: Work done over fall break

Record: Guneet sent me the firmware he had tested on the dev board to try and flash onto our chip on the pcb. We could not get this to work. 
Ordered different usb-bridges to try and fix this but ultimitly needed soldering gun to fix some pcb connection. No major changes in the 
PCB side.
