Overview: Testing

Record: Got the new current sensor and added it to the design. Retest the circuit to see if we were able to getting correct reading,
but had issue with values were being output but not correct. These value were way to high therefore we used the voltmeter and current clamp
to get the correct value using the input to each sensor. Using this, we created a video of us performing our test which is in the shared 
notebook.
