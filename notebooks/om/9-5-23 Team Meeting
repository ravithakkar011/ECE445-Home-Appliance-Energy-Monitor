Overview: Worked on project proposal

Record: We split up work of the project proposal and each tackled our sections. My sections included writing about the subsystem
and creating the block diagram that would showcare how they interacted. I Also helped create the high level requirements. We also needed a good ethics and saftey section that followed IEEE
standards since our project was dealing with high voltgae. Therefore I did some reasearch in the standards we need to follow and make sure
we are all situaionally aware.
