Overview: Team meeting with TA

Record: I let TA know where we were with the pcb which is we had all the parts, and just got the pcb since the order came in today. 
As the order was about to come in soon, he gave us the ok to present our mock demo using a breakboard circuit that mimicked out
functionalities. TA also came with us to the ECE shop to pickup other parts that we ordered. Also checked out the dev board.
