Overview: Mock Demo

Record: Showed our TA the breadboard model of our product. This showed him how our subsystem would be interacting.This model used a trnasistor
and not a power relay. We showed him the drain going from 0 volts to 5 volts and vise versa each time the input from the microcontroller was 
switch to high or low. Also discussed the firmware and gui progress with the TA.
