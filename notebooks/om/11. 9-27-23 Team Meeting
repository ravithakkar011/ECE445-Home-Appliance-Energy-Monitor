Overview: Team meeting to go over design document before submission

Record: I went ahead and finished up the cost and schedule. For schedule, I ask my teammates if they had any other large project, or 
periods in the semester where their focus needs to be on other things. Based on this feedback and everyone's schedule, I made the schedule
and had the rest of the team review their deadline to make sure they are ok with it. Once everyone proof read the document, 
we submitted and dicussed next steps. One goal I set for myself was to try and have the PCB ready for the pcb review the following week.
