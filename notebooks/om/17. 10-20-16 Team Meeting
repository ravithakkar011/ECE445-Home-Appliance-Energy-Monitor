Overview: Team Meeting regarding design document revisions

Record: Met with team to go over revisions that needed to be made to the design document. These revisions were based on feedback 
from the design review. This feedback can be found in the "post-ddr" document in Guneet's notebook. We put in our final block diagram, 
updated the parts table, and added requirement and verification tables. We also added more justification of why were are doing each thing.
