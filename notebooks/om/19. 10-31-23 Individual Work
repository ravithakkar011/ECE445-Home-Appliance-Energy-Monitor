Overview: Parts pickup and PCB order

Record: I went ahead and put in my PCB order for the PCB with test points. I also picked up my parts but was still missing my 120V to 5V
transformer. Since I still did not have enough parts for testing, I decided to begin making a breadboard model. This model would have three
sections to symbolize the three subsystems our design has:
  Microcontorller
  Power
  Sensor
The goal of this breadboard was to control output of the power relay via the dev board. This would be similar to our design except there
is no bluetooth or gui involved.
