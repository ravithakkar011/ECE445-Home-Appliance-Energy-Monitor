Overview: Mock Presentation

Record: We presented our mock presentation. Overall, we did not adhere to the slide rubric while working. We did not 
utilize the example slide deck provided. Therefore we would have to redesign our slides. To add on, we would have to make sure
to learn our slides better in order to maintain more eye contact while talking.
