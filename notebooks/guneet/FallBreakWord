Overview: Work done during Thanksgiving break

Record: I sent Om the firmware I had been working on to test on the ESP on our PCB. That code was not working properly so I spent time going over the datasheets and understanding how the ESP
works with analog signals. I refined my code based on that and got it ready for testing when we got back from break.
