Overview: Meeting with Machine Shop about the Enclosure

Record: We met with Greg from the machine shop to discuss what type of enclosure we could have. We had to ensure that this device would be properly insulated and could allow bluetooth signals to go through.
This socket would connect into this enclosure and then the enclosure would feed power into the actual appliance. The machine shop would send us a place we could choose enclosures from. They would have to 
provide us the sockets and extension cord wires as well.
