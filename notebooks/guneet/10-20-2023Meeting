Overview: Design Doc Revisions

Record: The design doc revisions were due soon. We went over the feedback we had received and went upon fixing everything. 
A lot of discussion was placed on how to address the power subsytem and which current sensor to pick. After we decided everything,
I worked on fixing the subsystem overview and subsystem requirements sections. We then submitted the updated design doc.
