Overview: Final Presentation

Record: We gave our final presentation to the professor. Some things we did not address were brought up. That included the concept
of power factors in power calculation. To add on, the omitted diode after the power relay was discussed. Overall, we were still 
given some applause for effort as we are all computer engineers trying to attempt a difficult power electronics project. We were
missing the R and V table in our slides so that was something we lacked.
