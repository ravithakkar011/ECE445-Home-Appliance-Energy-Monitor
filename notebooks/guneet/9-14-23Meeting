Overview: Proofreading and Finalizing Project Proposal

Record: Today, we met to go over the project proposal. One thing we came to a decision about was getting rid of the temperature sensor. It seemed pointless and we realized
a consumer would have to manually install that sensor in their device. After that we changed the descriptions on subsystems and proofread the final doc one more time 
before submitting.
