Record: Final Demo

Overview: We had our final demo. The professor told us to try ordering in a new sensor and seeing if it would work in time for our final presentation. 
During the test, our power relay would continue shutting off randomly. This could be due to a voltage spike occuring due to an omitted diode after the relay.
We were also told that it was dangerous to not have our enclosure's lid on while demoing and clicking the micrcontroller's reset button. Therefore, we had to 
drop off our enclosure to get a button added outside the enclosure in time for our final presentation.
