Record: Had to quickly fix up our power relay suddenly not working

Overview: Our power relay suddenly stopped working. This was probably due to the voltage arc situation from the night before. Our 3.3 to 5 boost was not providing enough power to the power relay. We had to
incorporate a transistor with a 5 volt signal. That signal would be fed into the power relay, thus appropriately powering this component. We then ran some last minute checking to see if our GUI was working
and got ready for our final demo.
